1. Implemented Na√Øve Bayes method using scikit-learn library
  Used dataset glass
  Used train_test_split to create training and testing part
  Evaluated the model on test part using score and
  classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
2. Implemented linear SVM method using scikit library
  Use glass dataset 
  Used train_test_split to create training and testing part
  Evaluated the model on test part using score and
  classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

Explained the reason why SVM is giving more accuracy than naive bayes algorithm
